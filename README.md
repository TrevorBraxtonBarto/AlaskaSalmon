# AlaskaSalmon
Data collected from ADF&amp;G reports on salmon yield by district by year

    All of this data exists on the Alaska Department of Fish and Game website under "Salmon Exvessel Prices by Area" 
    under the "Information by Fishery" section, "Salmon" tab.  Here it is just centralized to a spreadsheet, with two new data entries
    to help alleviate discrepencies between weight data and financial data (one of them must be more accurate)
